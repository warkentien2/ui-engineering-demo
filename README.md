# ClickUp UI/UX Engineer Mini Project

## Introduction

Hello! If you're reading this, we probably already talked, and you're about to begin work on your mini project. In this exercise you will show your component styling skills.

After downloading and installing the code, you will see a barebones application that displays information about Rick and Morty characters. Your goal is to apply the design from the Figma file you were provided with.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli).

## Development server

After installing npm packages, you can run `ng serve` to start a development server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/` and you will see the application. The app will reload automatically when you change any of the source files.

## Delivering final project

Please fork this repository and provide a link to your own public repository with completed project.

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI Overview and Command Reference](https://angular.io/cli) page.

If you have any questions regarding this exercise, please contact your recruiter directly!

Thanks again for your time and we're looking forward to seeing your final project!

Notes.:

- Used tslist to avoid escaping the scope of the assignment. Would reccomend migrating to eslint [migration walkthrough](https://medium.com/@bhavinmatariya99/painless-migration-of-tslint-to-eslint-angular-b25da240320c)
